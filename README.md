# Working Tittle "Tonic3"

A beautiful Ghost theme named Tonic.

## Usage

To build tonic uses grunt. 

```bash
$ grunt

$ grunt dev

$ grunt dist

$ grunt compress
```
- `grunt` is default and runs `grunt dev`
- `grunt dev` is used to build for development
- `grunt dist` is used for a distribute build in development
- `grunt compress` is used to zip an archive for uploading
